# Dynamic-Table-
Perform Insert,Delete,Select for a basic form submission for admin page and list no of items through a dynamic table(ejs) for user model. in this example i've used the basic bus ticket booking platform for inserting the details of the bus using admin page and displaying the number of buses according to the from and destination details using dynamic table using ejs.
